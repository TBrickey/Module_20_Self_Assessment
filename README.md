# Module 20 Self Assessment

## Self-Assessment

I worked well with the team, set up times to meet on zoom outside of class and contributed with the database and tableau. I do wish I could have come up with a better more creative idea.

## Team Assessment

We did it! We were able to come up with an idea, stay on task, complete a final project and present to the group. Everyone contributed and everyone cared about doing a good job. We used Python and python libraries, Scikit-Learn, AWS RDS, Quick DB, pgAdmin/PostgreSQL, sqlAlchemy, Machine Learning, & Tableau. The hardest part was coming up with an idea and question and staying on topic.  

## Summary of Project

Through our analysis we were able to identify key features homeowners were interested in investing in. Those features were ocean proximity and major city proximity.
